      <h2>FULL CASE STUDY<span> For LOCA-GO, a scavenger hunt app </span></h2>


      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        On my mission to providing access to relevant and upscale information for discovering cities and their
        surroundings, I developed LOCA-GO. It’s an easy and fun way to have a plethora of different tour guides
        at hand and select a matching one with just a few taps. With LOCA-GO, people are now able to undertake
        tours matching their personal preferences regarding topics, time and scope.

      <div class="">
        <h3>01 Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          As one of the first steps I took a look at two competitors apps:
          Actionbound and c:geo. Especially Actionbound has a great
          educational concept which gave me valuable insights in how to
          trigger the user with rewards. By evaluating UX-related issues,
          I could define an appropriate standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          User stories were defined to bring up a hypothesis for the
          audience and their usage of the app. The stories set the path as
          to where to look for my audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a row of interviews, both remote and in-person, with potential
          travellers using the app, I gathered valuable insights into their
          needs, goals and painpoints when traveling and beeing out
          and about. All answers were recorded and classified using
          affinity mapping. The classified answers lead me to three user
          personas (two main personas, one secondary persona) which
          served as base for further developing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h3>02 Concepting</h3>
        <p>
          My full fledged user personas were then taken as model to derive
          process flows in which their key actions found place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a co-existing hierarchy, I developed the first sitemap which
          contained all crucial actions I found in the flows. To continously
          determine if I my focus was still on the right path, I condudcted
          an online open card sort with ten participants. According to the
          findings from the card sort, I had to revise and refine my site map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with all the valuable insights, findings and deliverables I
          could gather so far, I used rapid prototyping to process these into
          digital mid-fidelity wireframes. By constantly refining these
          wireframes, they were then translated into high-fidelity wireframes
          and finally, I had my very first digital prototype which was ready to
          test with my users.
        </p>

      <div class="">
        <h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3>
        <p>
          The prototype was ready to be tested!
        </p>
        <p>
          I conducted moderated user tests with five participants to determine the
          overall usability and design. The testing went overall good and no
          catatrophes were discovered. The ranking of issues took place according
          to Jakob Nielsens scale of errors. All results from testing were gathered
          and classified in an affinity map and a rainbow spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with the new insights from testing, I took on another round of
          iterating the prototype. To accomplish a prototype which not only shows
          the revised screens but also usability standards, I included a range of
          Gestalt Principles the design principles defined by Google
          (functionality and visual clarity )and WCAG guidelines (accessability)
          found their way into my work as well. The revised prototype went
          into testing with fellow designers from Slack. For making it easier to
          absolve future iterations and developing the app, I installed a
          Design Language System.
